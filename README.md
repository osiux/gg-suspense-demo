# React Suspense Demo

In this repo you can see an implementation of the concepts we talk about in the [blog post](https://techblog.gumgum.com/).

- Lazy loading a component and display of the fallback UI with <Suspense />: https://github.com/osiux/gg-suspense-demo/blob/concurrent/src/Routes.jsx
- Concurrent React: https://github.com/osiux/gg-suspense-demo/blob/concurrent/src/index.js#L7
- Implementation of react-cache to use <Suspense /> fallback UI while making requests: https://github.com/osiux/gg-suspense-demo/blob/concurrent/src/api/api.js and https://github.com/osiux/gg-suspense-demo/blob/concurrent/src/components/AlbumsSection.jsx#L13
